DrifterBot info

Who is the Drifter?
The Drifter is a mysterious figure that made his appearance in the Destiny 2 Forsaken dlc. He acts as an edgy aquaintace with your character, always refering to ya as brotha/sistah.
The Drifter runs Gambit, an arena in which teams of four compete against each other to summon a primeaval and drain it of its darkness energy.

The bot
The purpose of this bot is to recreate the opening cutscene from the Gambit game mode, from the comfort of your own Discord server. The bot will incorporate:
  Random coin trick (Coin Ding Intensifies)
  Random enemy reveal voiceline (e.g. Hive! Bring a sword!)
  Random lobby dialogue (e.g. "Embrace the Darkness" or "We'll never see eye to eye... to eye with the Hive. Go poke 'em out!"
  Random Transmat dialogue (e.g. "Transmat firing!")
 
 Cant wait to provide more updates on the project!
